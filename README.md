# Zama dApp

Decentralized application prototype built with **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology.

## 📌 About the project
This project is a **demo decentralized application (dApp)** that shows how to combine:
- 🔒 **Zama Concrete** library for homomorphic encryption in Rust  
- ⚙️ Rust backend (Warp + Tokio) for handling encrypted requests  
- 🎨 React + Vite frontend for user interaction  

The idea:  
Users can interact with a backend that applies **privacy-preserving computations** thanks to Zama's FHE. This can serve as a foundation for secure blockchain dApps where sensitive data never needs to be decrypted.

## 🚀 Tech stack
- **Rust** (backend, encryption logic)
- **Zama Concrete** (FHE computations)
- **Warp** (async web server in Rust)
- **React + Vite + TypeScript** (frontend dApp UI)
